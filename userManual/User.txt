How to Play: 

Lotus is a very entertaining and simple game.  The rules are simple, the first player to get all his/her pieces off the board wins. 
You can begin the game with moving 1-4 spaces on the game board
 Example using the red piece: [R] moves you one space. [R, R] moves you two spaces. [R, R, R] moves you three spaces. [R, R, R, R] moves you four spaces. 
To move your pieces quickly off the board, you can stack your pieces on top of each other, each additional piece stack allows you to move one extra spot on the game board. For an example, if you have 3 pieces stacked on-top of each other you can move the top piece 3 spots.

On the game board, there are randomized special points. 

[]+5 : This special spot moves your designated piece five spots forward on the game board. 
[]+2:   This special spot moves your designated piece two spots forward on the game board. 
[]<<: This special spot moves your designated piece backwards on the game board.
